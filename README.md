Welcome to PieThon! This is a python module for the fun of it because i read some module stuff in a book.

![PIETHON TEMP](https://github.com/macisgreat/PieThon/assets/168867159/f652f080-7758-4313-aa3b-a9819d99a5f9)

The code must be used like "Piethon.c_to_f" instead of "c_to_f" because the code is not defined.
